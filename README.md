# Hotspot-Recognition

Welcome to my Hotspot Recognition Program. The goal of this program was to be able to identify where a "hotspot" is in an image. In this case a "hotspot" was defined as the location of a fire in an image. This program was a small part of a larger drone project. 

The drone project seeked to provide advanced situational awareness to aerial firefighters through the use of a remotely controlled drone that will geolocate hotspots within the fire and provide their location to a pilot via an augmented reality heads up display. The three main subsystems were as follows: the drone, the cloud, and the AR Headset. The drone is a DJI Matrice with an attached Nvidia Xavier and a Boson FLIR camera that performs georeferencing and sends hotspot temperature and location data over to the cloud. The cloud packages the data into a human readable model that can be viewed via a webpage.

This program helped identify the fire in an image which ideally would help fight fires more successfully.

Future: I would like to add more changes to this project such as location of the hotspot in coordinates and video hotspot location.
